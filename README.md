### Hi there 🙋‍♀️

I started my adventure with code a year ago and I fell in love with it. It gives me pleasure, satisfaction and a lot of fun.
<br><br>
I create my own projects at home and learn something new everyday. Practice, practice and more practice.
<br><br>
I am a Mother 🤱, Developer 💻 and former accountant 👩‍💻.
<br>
I love playing FIFA and Mortal Kombat on XBOX 🎮, taking part in competitions 🏆, spending time with my family 👨‍👩‍👧 and eating something good 🍕.
<br><br>
I'm using: **JavaScript, CSS, HTML**
<br><br>
**I am looking for a job** or internship to gain more experience.
<br><br>
Are you looking for ambitious, hard-working and easy-going person? You should ✉️ me and **give me a chance** 💌.
