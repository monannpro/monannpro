### Hi there 🙋‍♀️

I started my adventure with code a year ago and I fell in love with it. It gives me pleasure, satisfaction and a lot of fun. What more do I need? Job, of course 😁.
I create my own projects at home and learn something new everyday. Practice, practice and more practice.

I am a Mother 🤱, Developer 💻 and former accountant 👩‍💻.
I love playing FIFA and Mortal Kombat on XBOX 🎮, taking part in competitions 🏆, spending time with my family 👨‍👩‍👧 and eating something good 🍕.

I'm currently during 13-months Full-stack Development Course.

I'm using: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Express.js.

I am looking for a job or internship to gain more experience.
